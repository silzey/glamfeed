/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for GlamFeed.
 *
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles, reviews, and comments.
 * Products are publicly readable.  All write operations require authentication and proper authorization.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: User profile information, owned by the user with matching UID.
 * - /products/{productId}: Publicly accessible product information.  No write access.
 * - /users/{userId}/reviews/{reviewId}: Reviews created by a specific user.
 * - /users/{userId}/reviews/{reviewId}/comments/{commentId}: Comments on reviews, owned by the user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only write to their own profile data, but anyone can read it.
 * - Product data is publicly readable but not writable through the API.
 * - Reviews and comments can only be created, updated, or deleted by their respective owners.
 * - Listing operations are secured within user-owned subcollections.
 * - No global admin roles are implemented.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Reviews contain the `userId` of the author.
 * - Comments contain the `userId` of the author.
