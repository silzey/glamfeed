/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for GlamFeed.
 *
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles, reviews, and comments.
 * Products are publicly readable.  All write operations require authentication and proper authorization.
 * Admin users have special privileges.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: User profile information, owned by the user with matching UID.
 * - /products/{productId}: Publicly accessible product information.  No write access.
 * - /users/{userId}/reviews/{reviewId}: Reviews created by a specific user.
 * - /users/{userId}/reviews/{reviewId}/comments/{commentId}: Comments on reviews, owned by the user.
 * - /feed/{postId}: Public feed posts.
 * - /reports/{reportId}: Reports on posts.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only write to their own profile data, but anyone can read it.
 * - Admins can write to any user's profile data.
 * - Product data is publicly readable but not writable through the API.
 * - Reviews and comments can only be created, updated, or deleted by their respective owners.
 * - Feed posts can be created by any signed-in user, but only modified/deleted by admins.
 * - Reports can be created by any signed-in user. Only admins can update/delete them.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Reviews contain the `userId` of the author.
 * - Comments contain the `userId` of the author.
